A plugin that will simplify the process of maintaining a WordPress powered site’s navigation structure.

== Description ==

Creating a navigation structure is a simple enough exercise in WordPress, but when it comes to the refinement of it – specifically the order in which items should appear – you can readily see the shortcomings of the product.
Yes, it is possible to change the order in which the navigational items appear (via the Order attribute), but this is a painfully slow exercise. Believe me, I’ve been through this and it’s not fun – especially when a client cannot make up their mind about the order in which items should appear!
Suffice to say, there needs to be a way to help automate this task, which is where this plugin comes into play.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-menu-order.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory as well as the three sub-folders that come bundled with the plugin - `_images`, `_scripts` and `_styles`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Access `WP Menu Order` from the `Pages` navigation to begin organizing your existing page hierarchy.
